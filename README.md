# Nurse Staffing Optimization for Healthcare Providers

## Objective:
This project explores the relationship between nurse staffing hours and various factors such as facility ownership type, staffing levels during weekdays vs. weekends, and facility ratings. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can help healthcare staffing providers optimize staffing strategies and improve patient care.

## Overview:
The project involved:
- Data acquisition and storage on AWS S3
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using AWS Lambda
- Data transformation and analysis with AWS Athena and SQL queries
- Machine learning model implementation using Scikit-learn
- Visualizing the results with Matplotlib

## Key Findings:
- Government facilities have the highest staffing levels.
- Significant staffing gaps on weekends in states like Puerto Rico and New York.
- Higher RN and CNA staffing is associated with better facility ratings.

## Recommendations:
- Target for-profit facilities for contract staffing solutions.
- Focus on increasing weekend staffing in certain states.
- Increase RN and CNA staffing in lower-rated facilities.

## Technologies:
- AWS (S3, Lambda, Glue, Athena)
- SQL
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
